14	rosemary's babyrosemary's baby (1968) ***1/2of all the movies i know of which almost got made but didn't, i think the one i would most like to have seen is william castle's rosemary's baby . castle, who was working for paramount at the time, bought a three-year option on ira levin's novel of big-city satanism before it was even published. (he somehow got a look at the proof galleys, and decided the property was a sure-fire winner.) his bosses at the studio, however, thought the project had so much potential that they couldn't afford to let castle direct, lest he give them something along the lines of strait-jacket or the night walker . and they had a point, too- i willingly concede that. roman polanski turned in a much more sober and mature movie than castle probably would have, and since paramount's leadership wanted to handle rosemary's baby as a highbrow horror film for a mainstream audience, giving the job to somebody like polanski was the only sensible thing to do. but at the same time, i like those weird, cheap, garish little movies that castle was making in the mid-1960's, and i would love to have seen how the man behind the tingler would have handled a conspiracy to bring the antichrist into the world through the womb of a lapsed catholic. i'm sure we came out ahead with the version we got, but still...tv and stage actor guy woodhouse (john cassavetes, of the incubus and the fury ) and his wife, rosemary (mia farrow, from secret ceremony and the haunting of julia ), are in the market for a new apartment. after looking around a few other places, they stop by a very old, very beautiful building called the bramford, where there is a spacious, four-room suite available at the very top end of their price range. as the superintendent (elisha cook jr., of voodoo island and salem's lot ) shows the woodhouses around, he explains that the previous tenant has just recently died, and that if they're interested, they could probably snap up most of the old lady's furniture along with the apartment. the old-fashioned, oppressive furnishings aren't to rosemary's taste, but she loves the space itself, and she leans hard on her husband to make a deal. guy caves to the pressure (the bramford is, after all, within easy walking distance of the theaters where most of his jobs are likely to be), and a week or two later, the woodhouses are firmly ensconced within their new digs. rosemary even makes a new friend, a young woman named terry gionoffrio (victoria vetri, from invasion of the bee girls and when dinosaurs ruled the earth ), who lives on the same floor as rosemary with an old couple called the castevets. in fact, their unit shares a common wall with rosemary's, and the two flats had originally been sections of a single huge apartment. evidently minnie (ruth gordon, from whatever happened to aunt alice? ) and roman ( the lady and the monster 's sidney blackmer) castevet never had children of their own, and it scratched their parental itch to take terry in and straighten her out when they discovered her on the streets, whoring and doping and shoplifting her way to an early grave.guy and rosemary's friend and former landlord, edward hutchins (maurice evans, from terror in the wax museum and planet of the apes ), has a slightly different take on the bramford, however. over dinner with his vacating tenants, hutch spins a long series of yarns detailing a history of ugly events that have happened in the old building. first, there were the trench sisters, a pair of spinsters who lived at the bramford when it was new, and who made a name for themselves by killing and eating several small children. then there was adrian marcato, another illustrious bramford tenant of the 19th century, and a self-proclaimed warlock and practicing satanist. and of course, there was the usual succession of murders, suicides, and descents into insanity without which no haunted house- or haunted apartment complex, either, for that matter- would be complete. hutch doesn't take any of that colorful history terribly seriously, but he figures guy and rosemary might want to know about it if they're going to be leasing a flat at the bramford. a lot of folks wouldn't want to live under a roof that had seen that kind of action.in point of fact, the bramford's troubled past is about to carry over into a troubled present. soon after moving in, guy and rosemary come home from a late night out on the town to discover that terry has leaped to her death from the window of the castevets' apartment. roman and minnie were out at the time, too, and they, like the woodhouses, return just as the police are cleaning up the mess and trying to make sense of the situation. roman seems to take terry's death more or less in stride, but minnie is devastated. in the days that follow, rosemary finds herself spending a great deal of time with minnie, who is obviously in need of some youthful company just now. the old lady strikes rosemary as nosy, intrusive, and vaguely uncouth, but not without a certain grandmotherly charm for all that, and in any case, rosemary herself is far too polite to tell minnie that she's invading her personal space by popping over at all hours of the day. guy initially shares his wife's feelings, but after he meets roman when he grudgingly accompanies rosemary to dinner at the castevet place, he decides that his elderly neighbors aren't so bad after all. roman has led a busy life, traveling to just about every inhabited spot on earth in his 79 years, and his mind is plenty sharp enough for him to pour out his accumulated stories in a cogent and entertaining manner, unhindered by the rambling and repetition that so often attend the reminiscences of the very old. indeed, before long, guy starts spending enough time with the castevets to make rosemary jealous!soon after guy starts making a point of hanging out with roman, the circumstances of his life take a major upturn, although in a somewhat macabre manner. he unexpectedly lands a role in an important play which he had been turned down for, the actor who was chosen instead having been suddenly and inexplicably stricken blind. about the same time, he spontaneously suggests to rosemary that the two of them have a baby, something she had long desired, but which it is implied guy had been resisting. he even goes so far as to work out which dates would be most auspicious for conception. on the first of these dates, minnie comes over unannounced to give her neighbors some test samples of a new chocolate mousse recipe she's trying out, but she uncharacteristically allows herself to be shooed away after handing over the experimental desserts, rather than sticking around and scuttling guy and rosemary's romantic evening. rosemary complains of a chalky taste in her mousse, and an hour or so after dinner, she is struck by a wave of dizziness. it gets so bad that guy has to carry her to bed, where she spends the night having strange and disconcerting dreams. in the worst of these, rosemary is tied down to a bed in the castevets' living room, where a huge crowd of chanting old people look on while some kind of inhuman thing (it rather reminds me of the creature in the ghost of dragstrip hollow , actually) has sex with her. when she awakens the next morning, her body is covered with shallow scratches, and guy sheepishly admits that he had sex with her while she was passed out. "didn't want to miss baby night," he justifies rather lamely.rosemary does indeed become pregnant, and in her excitement, she fails to notice at first the odd reactions the news elicits from guy, roman, and minnie. her friend elise (emmaline henry) had steered her toward an obstetrician named hill (charles grodin, from the dino delaurentiis king kong ), but the castevets insist that she go instead to a friend of theirs named dr. abraham sapirstein (ralph bellamy, of the wolf man and the ghost of frankenstein ), who is widely regarded to be one of the best (and, not coincidentally, most expensive) ob/gyns in new york. minnie even talks him into giving the woodhouses a substantial discount. the course of prepartum care which sapirstein prescribes is curious indeed (it involves lots of herbal potions prepared by minnie castevet), but guy is adamant that rosemary adhere to it, even when she begins losing an alarming amount of weight and experiencing steady, intense pain in her abdomen. in fact, guy has pretty much turned into a yes-man for minnie ever since word came back that rosemary was pregnant. eventually, rosemary's other friends begin to suspect that something may be wrong, and hutch discovers that some of the rarer ingredients in minnie's herb drinks had historically been used in the practice of witchcraft. before he can progress any further in this line of inquiry, however, hutch lapses into a coma, where he remains until his death three months later. but just before the end, he regains his senses sufficiently to send an old friend, grace cardiff ( door-to-door maniac 's hanna landy), to rosemary with a book he picked up and the message, "the name is an anagram." the book is called all of them witches , and in it hutch has highlighted several passages which have eerie parallels in rosemary's life since she moved into the bramford. it also has a chapter on the notorious adrian marcato, which contains the information that marcato had a son named steven, who was born the same year as roman castevet. and after a few futile stabs at rearranging the letters in "all of them witches," rosemary realizes that "roman castevet" is an anagram for "steven marcato." all at once, rosemary thinks she understands what's going on. steven/roman is a satanist like his father, the circle of well-heeled old geezers who periodically convene at the castevet apartment are a coven of witches, and guy has thrown his lot in with them in order to advance his wobbly acting career. that dream she had on the night when her child was conceived was no dream, and as soon as the baby is born, the marcato coven will take it to use for some unholy ceremonial purpose. and of perhaps the gravest import, hutch's death and the blindness which afflicted guy's professional rival were almost certainly the result of hexes cast by the devil-worshipers. the only person rosemary can think of who might be able to help her is dr. hill, but how the hell is she going to convince him that she isn't just out of her mind with prepartum hysteria?rosemary's baby takes a noticeably different tone at each stage of the story, and some of those combinations of narrative voice and subject matter work better than others. the soap-opera-like first act begins to grate after the initial exposition is out of the way, and the second act is compromised by polanski's insistence upon treating the strange goings-on around rosemary's pregnancy like a mystery, when in fact it is immediately obvious that the devil-sex "dream" sequence is really happening, and that its loose and hallucinatory quality is due to the chalky-tasting drug which minnie castevet slipped into rosemary's chocolate mousse. we already know what's going on, and polanski risks eroding our sympathy for rosemary to the breaking point by taking so long to have her catch up to us. however, once rosemary gets it into her head that she has been the victim of some kind of satanic plot, rosemary's baby whips itself into shape and turns into one of the screen's best-ever variations on the theme of "just because you're paranoid, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody isn't out to get you." the scene in which rosemary explains herself to dr. hill is terrific; as she spills it all out from beginning to end, it gradually dawns on the audience how utterly demented the story sounds, until even we are no longer so sure of rosemary's sanity. it's a commendable trick polanski pulls off there, suddenly making us doubt what we have accepted without question for the full length of the film up `til then. finally, when the baby's birth ushers in the climax, the film takes another sharp tonal turn, veering into black comedy for the last few minutes. out of nowhere, the castevets' hitherto menacing cult comes to seem absurd- a bunch of old fogies trying to bring about armageddon when they can't even get it together sufficiently to quiet a squalling baby. and unlike the last time polanski tried to combine humor and horror, the final scene of rosemary's baby really works.more than anything else, i think it's mia farrow's performance that holds rosemary's baby together. from the beginning until nearly the end, she seems totally out of her depth, but in a way that inspires compassion rather than dismissal. when you think about it, the whole story is predicated upon a woman of weak will, accustomed to trusting in others to keep life running smoothly and constantly second-guessing her own instincts. at the age of 23, mia farrow had a childish quality about her that suited this movie's purposes perfectly, but combined with enough palpable intelligence to make it just as believable when rosemary finally turns the corner and starts looking out for herself and her unborn child. when the turnaround comes, the reaction it inspires is akin to that which elementary school teachers must feel when a bright but struggling pupil makes the decisive mental connection that enables him to grasp a difficult math problem. mounting frustration disintegrates, and you want to exclaim, "there! you see? i knew you could do it!" with a less engaging actress in the part, we might well give up on rosemary during the long stretch between her date with the devil and the cascade of eurekas that comes when she deciphers the puzzle of roman castevet's name. but there's something about mia farrow that makes you want her to be okay no matter how dense or hapless she might seem, and so the audience continues pulling for rosemary even against its better judgement.

laboratory, madison, wisconsinmany homeowners prefer a wood finish that preserves thenatural color of wood, such as the penetrating finishes, asopposed to the nonpenetrating film-forming finishes. exam-ples of these film-forming finishes are paints and otheropaque finishes and latex semitransparent stains. for interiorwood, clear film-forming finishes, such as polyurethane andspar varnish, provide a natural look. wood finished withsuch products is also easy to keep clean. for exterior wood,however, clear film-forming finishes do not last long becauseof exposure to direct sunlight. even if the coating is resistantto sunlight, the clear film permits the sunlight to degrade thewood at the coating-wood interface causing loss of coatingadhesion. under such conditions, clear finishes crack andpeel from the wood surface after 1 or 2 years, and the woodrequires extensive surface preparation before it can bepenetrating finishes provide a way to protect the surface ofexterior wood while allowing the characteristics of the woodto show through the finish. penetrating finishes, whichinclude stains, water repellents, and water-repellent preserva-tives, can be used outdoors. they do not require extensivepreparation of the wood surface because they do not crack andpeel from the surface. penetrating finishes can be clear orpigmented. clear penetrating finishes can both protect thewood surface from weathering and allow the wood's charac-teristics to show through the finish. however, such unpig-mented finishes have a shorter surface life than do pigmentedfinishes. nonpenetrating finishes, such as latex semitrans-parent stains and latex and oil-based opaque stains, areoften useful for situations where penetrating stains arethis publication describes the properties and use of stains onwood exposed outdoors. the discussion includes back-ground information on wood properties and treatment ofwood with preservatives. both oil-based and latex formula-tions of semitransparent and opaque (solid-color) stains arefactors affecting stain performance are growth ring orienta-tion; the amount of heartwood, sapwood, and juvenile wood;the durability of the wood; weathering; and moisture.growth rings are most easily seen in a cross-sectional viewof a log (fig. 1). the portion of the growth ring formedduring the spring (earlywood or springwood) is less densethan the portion formed during the summer (latewood orsummerwood). the most drastic density change occurs at thejunction of the latewood of one growing season and theearlywood of the next. the width of the growth layer, thethickness of individual cell walls, and the properties of thesecells depend on the species, the weather during the growingseason, the site where the tree is growing, and the age ofheartwood and sapwoodin addition to growth rings, another feature seen in the crosssection of a log is the apparent difference in color of thecentral heartwood portion compared with the outer sapwoodportion (fig. 1). although both heartwood and sapwoodprovide structural support, they serve different functions withregard to the life processes of the tree. water and nutrienttransport, the life support system of the tree, takes placewithin the inner bark and sapwood.the heartwood is not involved in moisture transport. itserves only as structural support and a storage area for manyof the organic chemicals produced by the living tree. thespecies-specific chemicals stored in the heartwood are calledextractives. in addition to the anatomical differences in wood,these chemicals give each wood species its other characteris-tic properties, such as color and natural decay resistance.although a few species, such as redwood and western red-cedar, have a reputation for natural decay resistance, only theheartwood of these species provides durability because of thehigh concentration of certain extractives.the wood formed during the first few years of a tree's growth(8-10 years for most species) is called juvenile wood. thiswood has abnormal properties that may cause large dimen-sional changes (generally in the longitudinal direction).these dimensional changes can cause severe warping oflumber. while mature wood changes only slightly in longi-tudinal dimension between its green and dry state (0.05%change), juvenile wood can change 3% to 5%. with dimen-sional change of this magnitude, fasteners may pull out andthe wood may split, bow, twist, cup, or crook.the pith or center of the tree can most easily be seen on theend grain of a log (fig. 1). if a particular board contains thepith, it is certain to contain juvenile wood. wood that con-tains juvenile wood can warp considerably as it dries becauseof uneven longitudinal dimensional changes. warp can beminimized by selecting lumber without the pith.some woods have natural durability (resistance to decay orrot). others can be made durable through treatment withpreservatives. durable species such as redwood and cedar arecommonly used for wood exposed outdoors, such as siding,shakes and shingles, decks, furniture, and fences. durabilityis imparted by natural chemicals, which are contained inextractives in the heartwood of these species. since only theheartwood contains extractives, lumber that contains a highproportion of sapwood does not have the natural durability oflumber that contains a high proportion of heartwood.nondurable wood species may be factory-treated with pre-servative for long-term durability for use in ground contact.these treatments are done in large cylinders, and the pre-servative chemicals are forced deep into the wood using highpressure. preservative treatments of wood are done undercarefully controlled factory conditions, and the wood usuallyhas a manufacturer's guarantee. lumber treated with preserva-tives may also have a quality stamp by an independentwater is one of wood's worst enemies. whether in the formof vapor or liquid, water can cause shrinking and swelling,which can lead to dimensional changes of the wood anddegradation of the finish. water causes decay or rot of thewood and early failure of the finish, and it accelerates theweathering of wood exposed outdoors.shrinking and swellingin general, wood shrinks as it loses moisture and swells as itgains moisture. more precisely, wood changes dimensiononly between an absolutely dry state (completely free ofmoisture) and its fiber saturation point (the point at whichthe wood fibers are completely saturated with moisture). formost species, this fiber saturation point typically occurs atabout 30% moisture content. at this point, all the water inthe wood is bound within the cell wall. at moisture contentchanges above fiber saturation, the cell cavities take on orlose unbound water but the wood cell walls do not changedimensionally. below the fiber saturation point, however,the wood changes dimension with changing moisture con-tent. the magnitude of this change is dependent on speciesand is always different for the three axes (radial, tangential,and longitudinal). a large percentage of wood finish degrada-tion (for example, paint defects, peeling, and cracking) resultsfrom moisture changes in the wood and subsequent dimen-water vapor and water effectsshrinking and swelling of wood occur whether the water isin the form of vapor or liquid. for example, wood swellsduring periods of high humidity and shrinks during periodsof low humidity; it also swells and shrinks as it gets wetfrom liquid water and then dries. if wood is exposed to watervapor, which occurs indoors, the moisture content can reachonly the fiber saturation point. this requires exposure to100% relative humidity for an extended period. since woodis seldom exposed to this level of relative humidity for longperiods, it seldom reaches fiber saturation because of highfigure 1-cross section of a log.humidity. however, if the wood gets wet from liquid water,it can quickly reach or even go beyond fiber saturation.problems with poor performance of wood occur when themoisture content of wood reaches or goes beyond fiber satura-tion, which is almost always caused by liquid water.categories of wood finishestrue penetrating wood finishes fall into two general catego-ries: (a) water repellents (wrs) and water-repellent preserva-tives (wrps) (williams and feist 1999) and (b) solvent-borne oil-based semitransparent stains. the advantage of apenetrating finish compared with a finish that forms a film isthat the penetrating finish allows the wood to breathe and thefinish does not peel. water repellents, wrps, and somestains are formulated so that the solvent carries the binder,preservative (mildewcide), and wr into the wood. anothercategory of wood finishes is the nonpenetrating stain finishes,which do not penetrate the wood but can be used like paint.water repellents andwater-repellent preservativeswater repellents and wrps are relatively simple woodtreatments that slow the uptake of water and help keep wooddry. the only difference between these finishes is that wrpsinclude a fungicide or mildewcide. otherwise, the composi-tion of wrs and wrps is similar: both contain 10% to20% binder such as varnish resin or drying oil (linseed ortung oil), a solvent, and a substance that repels water (waxor wax-like chemical). the oil or varnish resin penetrates thewood surface and cures to partially seal the wood surface.the oil or varnish also helps to bind the fungicide-mildewcide and wr to the wood surface. solvents includeorganic liquids such as turpentine, naphtha, and mineralspirits or water. the amount of wr varies among brands.some wrs and wrps are formulated with a low concentra-tion of wr so that they can be used as a pretreatment forother finishes (about 1% by volume). others are formulatedwith a high concentration of wr (about 3% by volume) andare meant to be used as stand-alone finishes.water repellents and wrps are effective when used on woodexposed outdoors above ground. in areas where decay is aserious problem or where wood will be in contact with theground (wood foundations or fence posts, for example), woodwill need far more protection than that afforded by surfacetreatment with a wr or wrp. in such cases, wood properlyprotected by treatment with a commercial preservative isrecommended. such pressure-treated wood is normally avail-able at lumber yards and should conform to recognized stan-dards for maximum service life.if pigments are added to wrp solutions or to similar trans-parent wood finishes, the mixture is classified as a semi-transparent stain. the pigment provides color and greatlyincreases the durability of the finish by protecting the woodsurface from sunlight. since semitransparent stains penetratethe wood without forming a continuous layer, they do notblister or peel even if excessive moisture enters the wood.semitransparent stains permit much of the wood grain toshow through; no film is formed unless too many coats arethe durability of a stain system is a function of the formula-tion (amount and type of pigment, resin, preservative, andwr), the surface characteristics of the wood species, thequantity of material applied to the wood surface, and theamount of sunlight to which the finished surface is exposed.changes in stain formulationsin the 1950s, the usda forest service, forest productslaboratory (fpl) developed a natural finish aimed at over-coming the susceptibility of oil-based film-forming finishesto failure through cracking and peeling (black and others1979). research showed that the first application of the fplnatural finish to smoothly planed surfaces that had been fullyexposed lasted 2 to 3 years. when the wood was refinishedafter weathering, the finish lasted much longer. two coats ofthe finish on roughsawn or weathered surfaces could last10 or more years. semitransparent stains similar to theoriginal fpl natural finish are now being marketed nation-wide by hundreds of manufacturers. these formulations areusually based on linseed oil or a modified oil. the oil pene-trates the wood extremely well when the finish is formulatedwith a solvent such as mineral spirits or turpentine (fig. 2).until about 1980, all penetrating stains were oil-basedsolventborne formulations. these formulations readily pene-trate the wood surface and do not form a coating (fig. 3);therefore, they do not blister and peel, even in excessivemoisture conditions. because stains do not form a coating,the wood does not need to be scraped before refinishing.thus, the stain is easily maintained on a variety of woodabout 1980, manufacturers started to change semitransparentstain formulations because of concerns about solvent evapo-rating from these finishes. many solvents react with pollut-ants in the atmosphere to form ozone, a component of smog.these solvents are collectively known as volatile organiccompounds (vocs). more stringent regulations that willaffect paint and stain formulations are currently being devel-oped under the provisions of the new clean air act (1991).formulations of finishes will continue to change to meetchanges in stain formulations include decreasing the amountof solvent, resulting in a formulation with a high solidscontent (high-solids formulations), substituting solvents thatdo not cause smog, and using waterborne formulations. thepenetrating characteristics of low-voc formulations varyconsiderably. many of these reformulated finishes penetratethe wood similar to traditional solventborne formulations,but others tend to form a film.for high-solids formulations that contain large amounts ofnatural or synthetic oils, the proper absorption of the finishcan be hampered by the sheer volume of oil on the surface ofthe wood. if the oil is a drying oil, it may dry before absorb-ing into dense areas, such as wide latewood bands on flat-sawn lumber. the resulting film will appear as shiny areason the surface. high-solids formulations are still being in-tensely developed, and improvement in the performance ofthese products is likely.there are currently efforts by many stain companies to de-velop waterborne stains that penetrate wood. these water-borne formulations have been only moderately successful atduplicating the properties of traditional oil-based solvent-preparation of stainsalthough directions for making semitransparent stains werepublished by black and others (1979), this formulation waspossible only because of the availability of pentachlorophenol(penta). this pesticide is no longer available to the con-sumer. in addition, the mildewcides listed by black andothers (1979) are only available in formulated finishes.therefore, it is not possible for the consumer to formulate amildew-resistant semitransparent stain. a wide variety ofcommercial finishes are available and many of these containeffective mildewcides.nonpenetrating stainsas originally formulated, a stain was synonymous with apenetrating finish. now, a number of nonpenetrating finishesare marketed as stains. these finishes include latex semi-transparent stains and latex and oil-based opaque (solid-color) stains. because these stains do not penetrate wood asdo the solventborne oil-based semitransparent stains, theymust be used and applied like paint and other film-forminglatex semitransparent stainsthe appearance of latex semitransparent stains is similar tothat of oil-based semitransparent stains, but the latex poly-mer does not penetrate the wood as does oil. the semitrans-parent look is achieved by the formation of a thin film. thisfilm is not thick enough to provide durability, and it tendsto degrade by flaking from the wood surface.latex opaque or full-bodied (solid-color) stains are similar tolatex semitransparent stains but contain a higher amount ofsolids (that is, they form a thicker film when applied to thesame area per amount of stain). latex opaque stains do nothave the hiding power of a true paint. by the same token, asecond application of stain will not hide the original stain.for example, if an opaque stain is applied over wood that ispartially unstained and partially stained or painted, thesedifferences may show through the new coating. a second coatof opaque stain will usually eliminate this difference. latexstains can also show lap marks (but not to the same extent asdo solventborne oil-based semitransparent stains) and extrac-tive bleed (particularly with lighter colors). latex opaquestains have good color retention, are flexible, and are lessprone to mildew than are oil-based stains.oil-based opaque stainsoil-based opaque (solid-color) stains are less flexible thanlatex stains and more prone to crack and flake, particularly ifapplied as a single coat over flat-grained wood. these stainsprovide good service life if applied in multiple coats, whichfigure 2-structure finished with a semitransparentfigure 3-western redcedar board. the left half of theboard was finished with a solventborne oil-basedsemitransparent stain; the right half was unfinished.build up the film, but they will not give the same appearanceas a penetrating stain.the preservatives used in stains deserve special mention.they should not be confused with the preservatives used forpressure treating wood, such as chromated copper arsenate(cca). the chemical treatments described here are containedin the finish and are formulated for brush application. theyare not available except as formulated in a finish. thesechemical treatments can be formulated in wrs, wrps, orsemitransparent stains. some commonly available preserva-tives are described in the following list. some europeancommercial formulations available in the united states maycontain preservatives other than those listed here. 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl carbamate (commonly calledpolyphase) is currently used in several commercial wrpformulations and pigmented stains. it is available in bothsolvent- and waterborne systems at approximately 0.5%composition by weight. 2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole (tcmtb) is usedalone or in combination with methylene bis (thiocyanate)(mtc or mtb). this preservative can also be effective asa fungicide for wrp and stain formulations. it is availablein both solvent- and waterborne systems at ~0.5% concen- zinc naphthenate is available commercially in wrpformulations and possibly in some new stains, in bothsolvent- and waterborne formulations. approximately 2%concentration by weight of zinc metal is recommended. copper-8-quinolinolate is available in commercial wrpsand may be available in stains. this preservative impartsa green-brown color to the wood. effective concentrationsrange from 0.25% to 0.675%. a mixture of bis (tributyltin) oxide and n-trichloro-methylthio phthalimide (the latter also commonly calledfolpet) is in a number of commercial stain formulations at0.5% to 1.0% composition by weight. pentachlorophenol (penta) was used quite extensively inwrp formulations until about 1980. it is no longer read-ily available to the consumer in the ready-to-use (5%penta) or the concentrated (40% penta) formulation becauseof its high toxicity and status as a carcinogen. the use ofpentachlorophenol is controlled and restricted to registeredpesticide applicators.two fpl publications on wood finishes regarding thepurchase and use of pentachlorophenol are outdated (blackand others 1979, feist and mraz 1978). this preservativehas been classified by the environmental protection agencyas a restricted-use pesticide and is no longer readily availableas a preservative for the formulas described in these publica-tions unless the user is licensed to apply pesticides. inaddition, pentachlorophenol has been removed from allcommercial stain and wrp formulations. all concentrationsof pentachlorophenol have been restricted for sale, includingthe 40% concentrate described in the fpl publicationsmany wood preservatives are being used as substitutes forpentachlorophenol in commercial stain and wrp formula-tions. however, most of these may be difficult to obtain formixing into a formulation. these products need to be pur-chased directly from the manufacturer or from a chemicalsupply house. some may be sold only to commercial opera-tors. registrations of preservatives are under constant reviewby the environmental protection agency and the u.s.department of agriculture. only preservatives that bear afederal registration number and carry directions for home andgarden use should be used. because the registration of pre-servatives is under constant review by state and federalauthorities, a responsible state agency should be consultedas to the current status of the preservative.manufacturers' safety and data sheets (msdss) shouldbe available from paint dealers for wrp solutions andsemitransparent stains. these msdss should containinformation on mildewcides or fungicides contained inapplication of stainsstains can be applied by brush, pad, roller, or spray equip-ment. brushing improves penetration and uniformity ofappearance. be sure to follow the manufacturerr's directionsfor temperature limitations because stains do not cure prop-erly if the temperature is too low. when staining a house,following the sun around the house and working only in theshade will help to decrease the tendency for lap marks toform. working on the entire wall while it is in the shadewill also prevent uneven penetration caused by variation insurface temperature. the stain may not absorb properly underthe eaves or on the north side of buildings (northern hemi-sphere) where the finish is protected from the weather. takecare to feather the new stain into the old stain under eaves.the north side of the house probably will not need to bestained as often as the other sides.oil-based semitransparent stainsthe most important difference between solventborne oil-based semitransparent stains and other stains and paints isthe ability of the oil-based semitransparent stains to penetratewood. these stains can be used on new or weathered woodwithout extensive surface preparation. they can also be usedon wood previously finished with other penetrating finishes(wrs and wrps) after the finished wood has weathered.they cannot be used on wood that was previously finishedwith a film-forming finish unless that finish is completelysolventborne oil-based semitransparent stains are the finishof choice for wood that is fully exposed to the weather(fig. 4). the finish repels liquid water but allows the woodto breathe (that is, it allows the wood to dry faster after wetor humid weather). since the stain does not form a film, itcannot peel. it can be used on both smooth and roughsawnwood, but it performs much better on roughsawn wood.on smoothly planed wood surfaces, a single application ofsemitransparent stain at the rate of 400 to 500 ft/l) is recommended. a second coat may notpenetrate uniformly on smooth surfaces, resulting in glossyand flat areas (fig. 5). the first coat on a smooth surface maylast only 2 to 3 years. however, if the wood is refinishedafter weathering, the finish may last 8 to 10 years.when finishing smooth surfaces of high-density species likedouglas fir and southern pine, the surface may be treatedwith a wrp and allowed to weather for a year before stain-ing. the first coat of stain will then penetrate uniformly andbe more durable because weathering makes the surface moreabsorptive. on surfaces that have been made absorptive byweathering or rough sawing, a gallon of finish should cover/l). an effective method is touse wet coats, applying the second coat not more than 1 hafter the first. both coats can then penetrate. if excess stainremains on the surface after an hour, a second coat should notbe used. to prevent formation of glossy spots, excess stainremaining on the surface 1 h after application can be removedusing rags or brushed to more absorptive adjacent areas. seesection on safety concerns for caution on handling stain-covered materials like oil-soaked rags. such materials are awhen refinishing semitransparent stains, the finish shouldpenetrate well into the previously finished surface. if the stainpenetrates properly, it will appear flat. if the stain does notpenetrate well, it will dry slowly with many glossy areas andprobably will not be as durable as it is on new wood. oldvarnish and paint films should be completely removed beforeapplying stain. again, stain that has not penetrated after 1 hshould be removed from the surface. for refinishing woodafter a previous application of stain has worn away, the stainmay penetrate better if thinned with not more than 1 qt ofmineral spirits per gallon of stain (ó0.25 l mineral spiritsper liter of stain). follow the manufacturer's directions.specific considerationssome oil-based semitransparent stains dry rather slowly; aday of good drying weather is generally required for thoroughdrying. lap marks can occur with stains because of theirsemitransparent nature (fig. 6). lap marks are caused byapplying the stain over a dry or partially dry area adjacent tothe area being finished, resulting in two coats at the junctureof the two areas. to avoid lap marks, the finish should beapplied by brushing with the grain of the wood for the fulllength of the board or course of siding without stopping. thestain should also be stirred frequently during application tomaintain uniform suspension of the pigment.figure 4-semitransparent stain after 2 years

many coats(the two top coats did not absorb).pollution preventionas mentioned previously, many organic solvents interactwith other pollutants to form ozone. this is a serious prob-lem in many metropolitan areas. ozone concentrations peakduring the late afternoon of warm and sunny summer days;sunlight catalyzes the reaction. when using finishes thatcontain these solvents, pollution can be minimized by usingthe following guidelines: avoid painting on days with an ozone alert. apply solventborne finishes late in the afternoon sothat the solvents can dissipate before the next day. limit painting to cloudy and/or cool days.oil-based semitransparent stains have good color retentionand durability on a variety of smooth and rough wood sur-faces. they can be applied to all exterior wood. stains for-mulated for outdoor use differ from those formulated forindoor use. stains for outdoor use contain toxic preservativesor mildewcides. read the label on the original containercarefully to determine if the material is allowed and recom-mended for indoor use. when in doubt, consult the manufac-turer to determine which mildewcide was used in the finishand whether it is appropriate for your proposed use.latex semitransparent stainslatex semitransparent stains can be used much like solvent-borne oil-based semitransparent stains, but they do notpenetrate the wood surface. as with oil-based stains, morefinish can be applied to roughsawn wood, and thereforelonger service life is obtained on these surfaces. as with oil-based semitransparent stains, use care to avoid lap marks.latex stains differ from oil-based stains in their refinishingcharacteristics; they must be applied to a sound surface.refinishing wood that has been finished with a latex semi-transparent stain requires substantial surface preparation. ifthe previous finish has begun to flake or peel or if the woodsurface has been degraded through weathering, the surfacemust be sanded or power washed. if the wood is refinishedbefore the finish begins to flake, a second application of stainwill increase the thickness of the film and improve its dura-bility. however, the thicker film will further obscure theoriginal wood. it is better to use a full-bodied opaque stainuse of latex semitransparent stains should be limited toplaces relatively protected from the weather, such as siding.it is best if the siding is protected with wide overhangs andif the building does not have high exposed gable-ends.latex and oil-based opaque stainsnonpenetrating stains can provide excellent service life towood and wood-based products such as hardboard. however,the wood surface must be carefully prepared if these stains areto be used on weathered wood or over wood previouslyfinished with semitransparent stain. the weathered surfacemust be removed prior to finishing. remove by sanding(50-80 grit sandpaper), wet sandblasting, or powerwashing.for best performance, the stain should be applied in multiplecoats. like latex semitransparent stains, both latex and oil-based opaque (solid-color) stains should not be used onstructures fully exposed to the weather. unfinished woodexposed to direct sunlight for longer than 4 weeks may nothold a film-forming finish properly. opaque stains can beused successfully on smooth and roughsawn siding andcomposites but should not be used on structures such asas with other film-forming finishes, the coverage of the firstcoat of opaque stain on smooth wood should be about 400 ft/l). on roughsawn wood, the coverageshould be about 250 ftcoverage should be obtained with the second coat. as withother film-forming finishes, the service life of opaque staindepends on the film thickness. since the thickness on roughwood is considerably greater (less coverage) than that onsmooth wood, the service life can be expected to be better.on rough wood, two coats may last 8 to 10 years. onsmooth wood, two coats may last only 4 to 5 years. asingle coat on smooth wood may last only 2 to 3 years.if latex stains are used like paint (that is, application ofmultiple coats to build up a film of 4-6 mil (0.1-0.15 mm)),they provide excellent service life. if multiple coats are used,the first coat can serve as the primer or a high-quality latexprimer compatible with the stain can be used for the firstcoat. as with any latex paint, it is important to follow thefigure 6-lap marks on deck finished with asemitransparent stain.manufacturer's recommendations concerning application,particularly the temperature restrictions. latex coatingsgenerally require at least 50øf (10øc) for several hours afterapplication to properly coalesce (consult manufacturer'ssince oil-based opaque stains are often formulated withlinseed oil, the first coat can absorb into the wood to someextent, particularly if the stain is thinned slightly with min-eral spirits. priming the wood with an oil-based primer willalso enhance the performance of the stain. an oil-basedprimer can be used with either oil-based or latex opaquestains, particularly with light colors where extractive bleedcould be a problem. a latex primer can be used only withlatex opaque stains. priming will help eliminate lap marksand decrease extractive bleed. this is especially importantwith lighter colors of stain. oil-based stains can be applied at40øf (5øc) or slightly lower.wood finished with an opaque stain can be refinished in thesame way as painted wood. the surface must be sound. allloose or flaking stain must be removed, and the surface mustbe free of dirt. any areas that have peeled should be sandedand primed; the stain can be used to prime these bare spots.after sanding bare spots, feather the edges of the finish sur-rounding the peeled area. however, many older finishescontain lead pigments. sanding wood painted with thesefinishes without proper protective equipment is a serioushealth risk. in addition, the residue must be handled ashazardous waste. contact local authorities concerning regula-tions for removal and disposal of lead-based paint and formore explcit information on health and safety concernsrelated to lead-based paint.specific considerationslike semitransparent stains, opaque stains can show lapmarks. to avoid lap marks, use the same techniques used forsemitransparent stains. follow the manufacturer's recom-mendations on temperature and length of time between coats.opaque stains can be used in situations where the appearanceof a stain is desired but penetrating stains cannot be used.for example, if a previously applied semitransparent stainhas weathered unevenly, it is often difficult to feather thesemitransparent stain from the bare (unstained) wood to thestained wood. opaque stains can be used to cover both areas.as mentioned previously, a second coat is necessary to maskthe differences between the stained and unstained areas, or thebare areas need to be primed first. again, be sure to sand allbare areas to assure good adhesion of the finish.removal of mold and mildewmildew should be removed from wood before it is stained(fig. 7). pretreat mildewed wood with a commercial cleaneror a chlorine bleach-water solution prior to refinishing.allow the wood to dry 1 or 2 days before refinishing.proper disposal of stain-covered materialsand lead-based paint: solventborne stains usually contain dryingoils. as the oils dry, they produce heat, which issufficient to ignite flammable items like oily rags. thisignition can often occur quickly - even while the ragsare left unattended during a lunch break. dispose ofstain-covered materials properly; they are a fire hazard.refinishing that requires disturbing, removing, ordemolishing portions of a structure that are coated withlead-based paint poses serious problems. the home-owner or contractor should seek information, advice,and perhaps professional assistance for addressing theseproblems. contact the department of housing andurban development (hud) for the latest information onthe removal of lead-based paints. debris coated withlead-based paint is considered hazardous waste andmust be disposed of as such.commercially available wood cleaners work quiteeffectively to remove mildew and other stains on wood.a mildew cleaner can also be made by dissolving1 part liquid household bleach and some powdereddetergent in 2 to 4 parts water.1/3 cup household detergent1 qt (5%) sodium hypochlorite (liquid household(1 cup = 0.2 l; 1 qt = 0.9 l)do not use a detergent that containsammonia; ammonia reacts with chlorine-containingbleach to form a poisonous gas. many liquid detergentsmay contain other additives that react with bleach.use care when applying stains. the solventborne formula-tions are volatile, flammable mixtures. do not breathe theirvapors or expose the solutions to flame or sparks. it is wiseto wear protective clothing on the hands and arms and totake care that the solution is not splashed in the eyes or onthe face. be especially careful using wrps because thesesolutions contain mildewcides, which are toxic.store finishes in original containers in a locked space, out ofreach of children and pets, and away from foodstuff. use allfinishes selectively and carefully. follow recommendedpractices for the disposal of surplus preservatives and pre-servative containers. immerse finish-contaminated materialsin water, then seal in plastic or an empty can until they canbe disposed of properly.wood is the material of choice for many structures. as withany building material, how wood is used depends on itsproperties, such as strength and stiffness, as well as finishingcharacteristics and maintenance requirements. problems suchas poor finish performance, mildew, checking and splitting,and wood decay can be controlled with proper care and main-tenance. such problems can be avoided or attenuated throughknowledge about the factors that affect wood, particularlywood exposed outdoors. if wood structures are given propercare initially and are maintained periodically, they can befunctional and structurally sound, as well as aestheticallypleasing, for decades. natural finishes such as wrps andsemitransparent oil-based stains can greatly improve thedurability and appearance of wood exposed outdoors.black, j.m.; laughnan, d.f.; mraz, e.a.products laboratory natural finish(rev.) madison,

31	peach, cinnamon and bourbon milkshake | 10th kitchenthe rules of the booze shake are as follows:(1) the first rule of booze shake is...  you can totally talk about booze shake. why do you ask?(2) go easy on the alcohol, then add more if necessary; we're not making a cocktail.  i find that half a shot per shake is plenty-of course, this varies on how sweet/easy to drink your chosen liquor is.(3) use quality ice cream.  the stuff that is pumped full of air, when blended, will deflate faster than the wide-eyed romantic ideals of tween twilight fans everywhere. (if you are judging me for knowing anything about this... that makes two of us.)  anyway.  i usually make sure to pick up ice cream that feels relatively heavy and has a relatively decent amount of calories. julie's organic did the job beautifully in this case.if you're a statistician type, and you were looking at my blog, you may conclude that i'll never make a milkshake without alcohol (i believe i've spiked three out of three recipes so far: here's one with berries , and one with kahlua ).that will probably be the case, at least until this thing catches on.  it's just what advocates for important causes do, you guys.  what's not to love?  you have your requisite pure, sweet creaminess, but a touch of the hard stuff brings a new, more complex, more interesting dimension to a tall, frosty, classic diner treat.  this is especially true if your chosen hard stuff is bourbon.  here, its spiciness is further enhanced with cinnamon, and countered with the fuzzy, juicy sweetness of summer peaches.  enjoy!peach, cinnamon and bourbon milkshake1 pint quality vanilla ice cream2 ripe peaches, peeled and cubed2-3 tablespoons peach preserves, depending on how sweet you like things1 scant tablespoon cinnamoncombine all ingredients in a blender until smooth and thoroughly incorporated.  makes 2 large milkshakes, or 3 small ones.6 responses to peach, cinnamon and bourbon milkshakejura | august 5, 2012 at 9:07 am |ok, i just made 2 recipes from your blog. this milkshake and zucchini pancakes. both were marvelous! you were right, bourbon totally works! i put homemade maple ice-cream in it.danguole | august 5, 2012 at 10:40 pm |sounds amazing-maple would be right at home in there!

36	day 547: marveling at the monstrous - worst movies, part 5 - 1000 words, 1000 daysin the pantheon of terrible movies - and that is a substantially large pantheon to be sure - the most gratifying and darkly satisfying to sit through are inevitably the classic sci-fi and monster movies of the 50's and 60's. these are films made with low budgets, cheap special effects, and pure hearts. it is a noble ambition to seize a few reels of celluloid and, while flying free of the hollywood studio system, attempt to make something beyond this world.these films are the easiest to mock, which is why a show like mystery science theater 3000 could enjoy a lengthy run. its audience consists of viewers who enjoy throwing their own one-liners at sub-standard theatrical fare when the tethers of proper decorum allow it.bill beard, my film studies prof for the last three years, abhors mst3k and its ilk. he feels these movies deserve the respect of being watched through the lens of a movie-goer from that era, unaware of cgi, untainted by the masters at industrial light & magic, and with a heart open to the shocks and wonders of creepy monsters and devilish aliens.i could see his point, but some of these flicks are just downright goofy.like eegah, a 1962 film that actually lends artistic credibility to pauly shore's encino man . it's the story of a woman who comes across a giant caveman in the california desert, at which point creepy hijinks ensue. notable b-movie director arch hall sr. put up the money for this mess, and cast himself and his son in the lead roles because why the hell not? he wanted to make his son, arch hall jr., into an all-around music and film star like elvis, so he made sure to include a pair of crappy rock `n roll songs in the soundtrack.the end result is a half-beach party movie and half-monster flick. the budget was a modest $15k, but with just over $3200 in box office numbers, i'd say this was a certified flop. the one winner out of this movie was the guy who played `band member' in the background - that was deke richards, part of the motown songwriting team who would go on to write "love child" for diana ross & the supremes, as well as "abc" and "i want you back" for the jackson 5.here's one worth tracking down. the beast of yucca flats stars tor johnson, the former swedish wrestler who hammed it up as an alien in edward wood's plan 9 from outer space . this time tor takes on the challenging role of a soviet scientist transformed into a groaning, mindless beast by a hearty dose of radiation. the film opens on a woman being strangled after getting out of the shower, her lifeless body then molested by the unseen killer. after that disturbing scene, not the woman, her murder, nor her killer are ever mentioned again. ever.the movie was shot without audio. a voiceover narration fills in a lot of plot points, and any character dialogue or gunshots are carefully placed so that the speaking character is facing away from the camera or else way off in the distance, and the gunshots occur out of frame. but that's okay - characters who do sustain life-threatening injuries from the bullets in the story quickly recover and continue on as though nothing happened. this movie is 54 minutes of pure quality.let's leap back to 1953 for a moment, and contemplate the brilliance that was robot monster . in the not-too-distant future, the evil alien ro-man has wiped out all of humanity except for eight people who have developed an immunity to his death ray. this hideously executed high-concept b-movie made the ultimate narrative mockery of its audience at the end by (spoiler!) making the entire thing a dream by one of its characters. fuck you, movie patrons! it was all a lie!a little credit though for writer/director phil tucker, who stitched together this drek for only $16,000 but still managed to earn a cool million at the box office. maybe this was due in part to the exquisite costuming of ro-man, who was supposed to appear as a robot but because they couldn't afford a good costume wound up being a guy in a gorilla suit wearing a diving helmet.tucker also managed to nab elmer bernstein - perhaps because of some blackmailing situation - to craft the film's score. bernstein is best known for his work on the magnificent seven, the great escape and the ten commandments . i'm betting robot monster didn't crack page one of his c.v.the creeping terror won't give you nightmares, unless your greatest fear is wasting 75 minutes on a schlocky waste of celluloid. this one is about a slug-like creature that lands on earth and terrorizes a small american town. the spaceship landing was created by using footage of a rocket taking off and simply reversing it. hey, it was 1964 - maybe that's what people thought it would look like.stirling silliphant was a successful screenwriter, penning scripts for the poseidon adventure, the towering inferno and one of my favorite films, in the heat of the night . it was robert, his half-brother (i don't want to say fredo-esque, but come on) who wrote the screenplay for the creeping terror . but the lion's share of the blame for this mess should probably drop its staining goo onto the shirt of the director/star, vic savage.this is how i picture someone with the name `vic savage'.somehow, savage lost the original soundtrack to the film, resulting in yet another attempt at voiceover narration and post-production dialogue fill in order to keep it from being a silent movie. only this time the narration was so poorly executed, at times it bleeds right overtop the dialogue, rubbing out key discussions by the characters.the special effects look to be sub-par, even for this genre of low-budget wonkiness. a couple of times, as the giant slug-thing wanders about, it becomes painfully obvious that the creature consists of little more than some shag carpeting thrown over a pair of unfortunate actors, whose sneakers are clearly visible underneath.look, i have no problem with cheap movies. sometimes their charm and best efforts outshine their flaws and shortcomings. but often they don't. that doesn't make it any less fun to sit and watch them, but it does mean that you'll probably be viewing them with a skeptical and mocking eye, not with the generally sincere gaze of a naive and open-minded patron from the time.that's okay. i think that makes it even more fun.i'm not a fan of the hexagon. i once tried putting cinnamon in mashed potatoes to see if it would taste good. it didn't. i feel somewhat emasculated when i'm entering a password for the first time, and the site tells me it's not a strong enough password. i can juggle, but only for about three or four seconds. i like cars, and my dream vehicle would be shaped like the chrysler building, but a little sportier. also, horizontal.this entry has 3 commentsi. m. soa-frayed wrote:i may have already mentioned this, but "the creeping terror" is my choice for the worst film i"ve ever seen, for the reasons you mentioned, and many more. favorite scene is perhaps the big dance, where a five piece combo is on the stage, while the soundtrack features a small swing band, of perhaps three times that many players.one notable critic picked dwain esper's "maniac" (from 1934) as the worst movie ever made. i've seen that one, too, and it's astonishingly bad, too.so would you recommend the creeping terror as a movie so bad it's actually fun to watch and laugh at? those are always fun.as for the band situation - that seems to be a running trend among old (and sometimes current) movies and tv shows, when you can hear a keyboard or even a tambourine and there's none present. one of those nit-picky things that always ruffles me when i see it.i. m. soa-frayed wrote:oh, yeah, creeping terror" is certainly one to sit and laugh at with friends. there are painfully dull sections, but they're made up for in sections where, for example, the narrator is telling us what the two men on the couch are talking about, and suddenly veers off into a sociological discussion of buddyhood, and how it is affected by marriage. then, as the silent conversation on screen turns ugly, the narrator (relatively calmly) tells us that one of the guys is telling the other to go to hell.i agree with you about the band thing - not synching up - but in this case, it's really ridiculous - there is a large horn section playing a twist sort of number, complete with full rhythm section, while on stage, there are perhaps five guys.notify me of follow-up comments by email.notify me of new posts by email.

42	10news - camp pendleton fire forces evacuations - 10news.com - newscamp pendleton fire forces evacuationslast updated: 1905 days agoa brush fire blackened hundreds of acres in the southeastern reaches of camp pendleton monday afternoon, forcing evacuations in base housing areas and neighborhoods in nearby oceanside, authorities said. at 8:45 p.m. monday, fire officials ordered several streets in bonsall evacuated. they are conejo rd., wilshire rd., caroline lane parts of sleeping indian road. the neighborhood is immediately north of an area in the city of oceanside evacuated earlier. more than 1,000 home have been evacuated so far. the blaze -- the second to erupt on the grounds of the marine corps base in less than a week -- began spreading amid dry, moderately breezy conditions about 3 p.m., according to cal fire. within an hour, the flames had spread over "75-plus" acres, and by 5 p.m. the burn area had grown to more than 500 acres, said nick schuler, a captain with the state agency. by 8 p.m., the number of acres burned had grown to 1,500, according to calfire spokeswoman, roxanne provaznik. schuler said he had received no reports of structural damage. authorities cleared all residents out of several base housing areas around vandegrift boulevard and from homes along alexandrine court and papagallo drive in oceanside. cal fire sent engines and aircraft to help military personnel and crews from several area municipal fire departments fight the blaze, schuler said. among the airplanes attacking the flames were two bombardier cl-415 "super scoopers," large craft that skim available bodies of water -- in this case, the nearby ocean -- to fill the tanks they use to fight fires. last week's blaze broke out wednesday and blackened about 1,500 acres in a remote part of the base, but resulted in no structural damage or evacuations. late monday evening, marine corps officials said the cause of the fire remains unknown but there were no live fire exercises underway when the fire broke out.copyright copyright 2008 by city wire. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

launchestwitter officially announced its new music service on the good morning america show this week. the new service is launching as a web platform and an ios app.twitter music has a lot of similarities to other services. it is broken down into four tabs: suggested , #nowplaying , popular , and emerging . popular and emerging simply pull in info from we are hunted's platform to determine what's trending and display up-and-coming artists. suggested and #nowplaying are more integrated into twitter's huge data set. suggested recommends songs and artists by pulling in twitter follower data. this includes musical artists that you follow on the service (or on twitter), as well as artists that the people you follow are following. #nowplaying plays music that is tweeted out by people you follow using the #nowplaying hashtag.linkedin updates mobile appsthis week, linkedin announced some major updates to its iphone and android apps.joff redfern, head of mobile products for linkedin commented that the previous linked in mobile apps "were just not as shiny as they were one year and eight months ago," and said of the new app that, "we've had the whole company using it. and they have given us 10,000 individual pieces of feedback."the new look is based around an interactive activity stream pulling in content posted by people in your network as well as posts from influencers as well as news from within your network. linkedin uses algorithms to help personalize this experience to each user. the new apps also give users the ability to comment on items in their stream, as well as endorse items, by way of a new glowing thumbs-up icon that expands when you tap on it.pocket debuts send to friend featurepocket calls itself a save for later service . this week it debuted a new feature which allows users to send content saved to their pocket accounts to contacts from inside the app. the service tested a range of approaches but settled on email. pocket founder and ceo nate weiner explained:"if you think about consuming, the act of doing it is private - you're not sitting next to somebody reading, but once you're finished with it you want to share. with pocket, we feel like we've done a really good job of that private consumption experience, and with this release, we're thinking about how do we solve that social side of things. what we're seeing is, when you look at pocket and how people share today, the number one way people share is via email."pocket's new share menu surfaces a person's most frequently used share sources, which can now include friends and family they email most.pocket services 35 million saves per month which is around 40% up on 2012.twitter introduces keyword targeting adsthis week, twitter introduced keyword targeting to its ad platform allowing brands to plan and serve ads to users based on specific words in users' tweets. twitter says the service is rolling out across all of its ad network, mobile and desktop, covering 15 languages and all markets where it currently serves ads.twitter blogged that one of the most important aspects of this new feature is that it will enable brands and advertisers to target consumer intent."let's say a user tweets about enjoying the latest album from their favorite band, and it so happens that band is due to play a concert at a local venue. that venue could now run a geotargeted campaign using keywords for that band with a tweet containing a link to buy the tickets. that way, the user who tweeted about the new album may soon see that promoted tweet in their timeline letting them know tickets are for sale in their area."the new keyword targeting tool will be available both through the twitter ads dashboard and through twitter's ads api.read more on the twitter blog

launched at the twitter4brands event at the london's tate modern this week, showed how positive tweets about a brand drive consumer demand and drive sales.the gaming focused study found that a 30% increase in positive tweets is four times more effective in driving sales than a 30% increase in traditional above-the-line advertising, and the effect is most pronounced when it comes to sports games.kmart ad tops the week's viral charttoilet humor, yes, but a rather bold move by kmart's ad team propelled their latest online video promoting home delivery to top spot. the chart was compiled by brand republic in association with unruly media and ranks ads according to the number of times they were shared across the social web. so far approach 14 million views since being uploaded on 10th april.syncapse release latest facebook fan value studythis week, syncapse released its latest study on the value of brands' facebook fans. according to the white paper (conducted by hotspex and collected from more than 2,000 panellists from the us), the value of a fan has risen to an average of $174, from $136 three years ago.michael scissons, ceo of syncapse, commented: "recent years have been characterised by hype and a competitive race to acquire the most facebook fan connections, but brand marketers are sobering up and beginning to ask hard questions around the roi of social marketing."read more on brand republic .morgan freeman reddit ama turns sourmorgan freeman [allegedly] took to reddit this doing an ama for his new movie oblivion. despite posting proof that it was really him answering user questions, there was a large contingent of redditors that believed it was just a pr pro simple filling in for him as the answers had a just little too much formula about them.disappointed fans took to reddit to complain in the droves with others seeking solace in tumblr or youtube impersonations.whatsapp bigger than twitter?this week, whatsapp ceo jan koum took to the stage at allthingsd's dive into mobile conference in nyc. he said his app now has more monthly active users than twitter with some way over 200 million (a figure reached by twitter in december) and was now supporting around 8 billion inbound and 12 million outbound messages per day.facebook launches cost per action adsthis week, facebook launched a new series of cost per action ads. the new model lets advertisers define the action that is most important to them and set a maximum price they're willing to spend for each action of that type.because facebook ads include so many potential actions for users to take, from photo views, timeline visits, page likes, post likes, comments, shares, link clicks, etc, there's a lot of potential wasted actions generated by ads served. the changes will mean only the desired actions get paid for by the advertiser. any other clicks or engagement won't be charged.for now, cpa bidding will be found in the ads api only and not accessible through the power editor or main self-serve ad tool.read more on facebook's developer site .twitter and bbc america strike deal for branded contentthis week, twitter signed a deal with bbc america to serve video

54	harmonic technology pro-silway mk. 2 on 10 audioharmonic technology pro-silway mk. ii interconnectsdate: december, 2001point. counterpoint. this was a difficult review to kick off, not because these interconnect cables are hard to describe, but because any component review needs to place the item in some sort of context. this is especially true for interconnects, because more than any other component, the performance of interconnects seems to be very system dependent. so we'll go back to the review of the harmonic technology truthlinks that were reviewed on these pages about a year and a half ago, and compare the copper/silver pro silway mk. iis to their all-copper siblings.let's get the housekeeping out of the way first: extended break-in is mandatory to remove the common nastiness of glare and grain, and ill-defined bass. hook these up to your tuner - you have a tuner, right? one of the best cable-burn-in devices made! give these cables at least 250 hours of line-level use before making any judgments about their sound. then you'll find the pro silway mk. iis are excellent cables.there is a fine layer of coarseness with the copper truthlinks that simply disappear when the pro silways take their place. the truthlinks do their job very well, and this (oh no, here it comes) "dirty window" effect is not readily apparent. but replace them with the pro silways, and there is an immediate and significant change for the better. this is evident from the lower midrange and up through the highest treble one can hear. the difference is immediately noticeable, and at first sounds like a lowering of the overall volume level and a slight loss of dynamics. but after just a minute, it becomes very apparent that the sound has become more relaxed, with a marked increase in low-level resolution. listen to a bell on these cables and you'll hear a beautiful clarity and revel in the decay as the sound slowly disappears into infinite silence. remarkable!after switching to these cables, there is a feeling like a sigh, where a tension to the sound is removed and the listener can focus much more easily on the presentation. instruments blossom more fully, losing a small but significant restriction to their full potential. there is an increase in the quietness of the background and a reduction in the annoyance of vinyl clicks and pops and other recording artifacts. the latter seem to be further disconnected from the musical content, making them easier to ignore.looking at the low end, these cables offer an over-all improvement over the truthlink, but not one as unconditional or as important as the benefits heard in the midrange and treble. bass resolution is increased slightly, while bass power and impact are reduced. the result is a decreased ability to hear the hall in which the music was recorded. i wouldn't buy these cables for their bass performance, but if your system is over-ripe, they may be just what you need.the pro silway mk. iis are very good cables, and easily worth the asking price. whether they are the best in class for your system is a question only you can answer. after enjoying the pro silways superior high frequency performance for several months, going back to the truthlinks was not an easy task. this upgrade is one-way.

63	spanking pictures | 1001 spanking fantasies | page 12category archives: spanking picturesgoth, gothic, i don't know, those crazy but cool people that always wear black and crazy outfits. there are a lot of amazing outfits out there i wish i owned, a lot of sexy ones too. go to a gathering of these people (this is after all from my `what you might see in public' album) and you are bound to get your eyes one some amazingly sexy outfits.like this woman, she's wearing a dress, but it's a cagedress, so she gets to show off her nice legs, heels, stockings and ruffled panties.of course if she'd have to be spanked, the only way would be to take off that skirt, leaving her in panties and stockings. same for her taking you otk, imagine laying over those nyloned legs as she bares your bottom, yum!something i've always loved is a little humor mixed with spanking. a nice and interesting back-story to fantasize about, but first a little laugh. the drawing i'm sharing today is one of those cartoons that brings you spanking, but in a funny way. it's one of many by the author, all titled `sammy simpkins loves spanking'.most of these are in a school setting, where sammy constantly gets in trouble (and she loves it) and sometimes getting her friends in trouble (who don't always love it).in this first one however (also the first i read) sammy is spanked by a farmer, for harassing his livestock. now that does bring some interesting ideas, being bent over the gate, dangling as you're being spanked, for taking a (trespassing) shortcut over a farmer's land, perhaps stealing some of his apples...sammy of course is used to the strict school canes, not a farmer's hand, so he encourages him to spank a little harder.(i always love a good public spanking fantasy)we all know them, the photo's of amazingly sexy girls posing nude on the beach. and we all know they've been shot by professionals on private beaches. we can go to any nude or non-nude beach and hope to see some attractive girl with (almost) no covered body parts. but never will they be as perfect as the person in the professional photograph.still, that doesn't stop us from fantasizing about the sights we might see on our way to the beach, or while tanning in the sand. who knows, someday we might get lucky and see someone as perfect as in the following picture. long red hair (my personal favorite in women) and an ass that just begs to be spanked.this today is the 50st post on my blog, and to celebrate i decided not to share just one picture, but a bunch of them.i decided on a cartoon/story by kamitora. the setup is simple, yet very original, i haven't read any similar story on the internet anywhere else. we start of in a porn set, but the male actor isn't aroused just yet, he's nervous in front of the cameras. kim, a `helping hand' so to speak gets the job of getting him turned on before the cameras start rolling again. - now that's a great fantasy for a job, getting porn actors ready off camera lol - and she knows well what gets a man hard. she first is naughty and then tells him she deserves a spanking...what i love about the story is that kim suggests the punishment herself, but then apparently got more than she hoped for. buck - the actor - gives her such a tanning it sends tears down her cheeks and breaks a clapperboard across her bottom.the embarrassment of getting a real hard spanking instead of the erotic swats she had anticipated to get him hard, together with the burning sensation of her bottom and the arousal of secrecy get her so wet that she cums while being spanked across her lap. i've been there, there's nothing so arousing and embarrassing at the same time as getting an orgasm purely from being spanked.in the end buck is sent back to the cameras, ready and rock hard.it starts of with a cheesy porn setting. though i love the line `i offer you my body as payment.'now kim, the `helping hand' and lovable spankee is introduced.she `examines' the problem.now for being naughty (though she might have over done it lol).`oh i'm so sorry, don't you think i deserve to be punished?'buck doesn't have to think long about that: `pull your pants down.'a clapperboard makes for a very interesting implement.and when that breaks, the panties come down for a handspanking.begging him not to stop, she's cumming.a nice cum for the naughty spanked lady, but now it's his turn.enough spanking fun, cameras are rolling and buck is ready.and... perhaps kim tried her best just a bit too hard.there are two kinds of spankable girls i believe.there are the `cute' kind, adult girls with pink panties and innocent faces, or ruffles and short girlish dresses.and there are the not so innocent kind, those with that naughty look in their face, wearing sexy lingerie, just begging you to take them across your knee.you don't have to be just one of them either. in every day life i would probably be one of those cute innocent girls. but if you look at my avatar, you know i can be the sexy one too. it depends on your mood, your attitude and just picking the right outfit.today i'm in the sexy naughty girl mood, and that's why i'm sharing a picture of such a sexy young lady with a sexy spankable bottom.after yesterday's fun spanking story, today we're being strict again.this old picture has a very strict look about it, a naughty girls mother (or aunt, whatever you prefer) is holding the switch, with a chair ready for the unlucky girl to bend over. knowing what's coming, the naughty girl submissively raises her skirt as she approaches her punishment, her panties already lowered to her knees.this is amongst the first spanking pictures i found, back when i was just getting into the whole spanking scene. it was one of those pictures that made disciplinary spanking just a big of turn on as erotic and fun spankings were. i couldn't look at this picture that is obviously about discipline, without still getting very aroused.http://1001spankingfantasies.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.phpanyone who has seen the movie `the secretary' can only think of one thing when he sees today's picture. well actually anyone who is into spanking can only think of one out of two things when they see today's picture:1: oh wow i'd love those legs and that bum over my knee to teach this naughty secretary a lesson.2: oh wow, i'd love to be across those legs to receive a lesson from this strict lady.if you had any other thoughts, please don't hesitate to share them, and enjoy:5 comments | tags: bent over desk/table , dressed , f , photo , secretary , stockings , work | posted in spanking picturesi'm sharing one of my favorite spanking drawings today. we have one young lady being spanked by another. the spanker looks a bit young to be her mother, so perhaps an older sister, or better even, a girlfriend. *giggles*i love how she placed a towel over her lap and then pulled the naughty girl right out of the bathtub and onto her lap to give her a spanking on her wet bottom. really like the spanker's shower cap with curls peeking underneath and the shape of the bath, really gives an old fashioned feel to the picturethere's a lot of scenarios i can think of for such a spanking. the spanker might've just gotten home and discovered something the naughty girl did, not waiting until she finished her bath to spank her. or the girl has been in her bath for hours, refusing to come out and the spanker has had enough of her lazyness. perhaps they had to share the bathroom and the naughty girl hadn't kept herself to her allotted time, using the bathroom too long, making the spanker almost too late for some appointment...what i love about these kind of spankings - in fantasy, never been spanked in bath myself - is the nudity. when you're spanked by friends, they have a reason to bare your bottom, but not to make you undress, that would become too erotic. but if you're undressed to start with well... also the wet bottom is an interesting part of this kind of spanking, it gives a whole different feeling to be spanked on a wet bum.a very cute picture today, a cute little girl playing with her teddy bears. well we now all know the naughty fantasies in her head, don't we? cute spanking scene with the girl in girlish clothes and ruffled panties, little teddy covering his eyes and mr bear raising his hand ready to spank.really like the setting with the old sofa and the angle of the light, makes for an old grainy photograph. the girl and especially her panties are just supercute. i always love the combination of cute and innocent with the kinkyness of spanking.again, don't know who made this, just found it on the internet. if someone tells my i will give credit etc...leave a comment | tags: bent over sofa , cute , f , fun , hand , panties , photo | posted in spanking picturesanother drawing by kamitora today, featuring a well-spanked girl on a card. there's no series of this unfortunately, i would love to own a card game full of kamitora's drawings on them. i wonder if `ten of clubs' is meant as a pun on spanking haha...anyway, very lovely picture, the look on her face is adorable, and her bottom is really glowing red. her too small panties are just too cute (click the picture if you don't see it full size).all i can think of now is, do you guys know any spanking card games?like there is strip poker, but is there spanking poker? do you know any other card games with a spanking twist? have you perhaps invented some yourself? please let me know in the comments, thank you.

69	hemy neuman trial: 'i'm a great, great executioner' | 11alive.com hemy neuman trial: 'i'm a great, great executioner'7:39 pm, mar 9, 2012 | commentsmurder defendant hemy neumanandrea sneiderman and hemy neumanrusty and andrea sneiderman with their two childrenfacebook twitter google buzz del.icio.us digg reddit newsvine buzz up! fark itlocal news headlinesdecatur, ga. (wxia) -- "i'm a great, great executioner," is a phrase jurors heard from hemy neuman's own mouth during his murder trial on friday.neuman made that statement during a videotaped interview with prosecution psychiatrist dr. pamela crawford one year after the november 2010 murder of rusty sneiderman.sneiderman was gunned down outside a dunwoody day care center just after dropping off one of his two young children.neuman admits the killing, but his lawyers are trying to convince a dekalb county jury that they should find him not guilty of murder because he's insane.before resting their side of the case thursday, the defense put up several witnesses who claim neuman has a bi-polar psychiatric disorder that causes delusions.he claims demons and angels drove him to kill sneiderman so he could have his wife and rescue her children from the same type of abuse he suffered as a child.neuman was infatuated with the widow, andrea sneiderman, a co-worker at ge, who he claims shared an on again, off again romantic relationship on business trips.but testifying for the prosecution on friday, dr. crawford said she thinks neuman is not insane and did know right from wrong when he shot rusty sneiderman.prosecutors played several clips of her november 2011 video interviews with neuman.in the video clips neuman admitted that he methodically planned rusty sneiderman's killing, just as he would have planned any of the numerous work projects he managed for general electric."he thought of stabbing him, but he said that would be too messy and he'd get stuff on him and he didn't think that was a good idea," dr. crawford testified."he thought about poisoning him and how he would go about doing that; he thought about staging an accident, but he said when he looked at each of those scenarios, he said that since his goal was to kill him, he didn't want to take the chance of just injuring him," she added.in the videotaped interview, the jury heard newman, himself, explain how he considered those various methods.he also described how he rented a car, wore a disguise and snuck up to the sneiderman home in a failed attempt one week before the actual killing.but newman said that attempt was thwarted when rusty sneiderman came outside to check on a gas leak and spotted neuman lying in the yard.at that point, neuman said he fled on foot.he also bragged at length in the video sessions with dr. crawford about how he juggled several multi-million projects for general electric and earned exceptional reviews for most of his work.that's when he said, "i'm a great, great executioner," to describe his abilities.dr. crawford said anyone who was genuinely manic would not have been able to plan something like a murder in such great detail, but would have acted impulsively.she said his approach to the killing was just the opposite."he said that he approached it as a project, as any detailed project that he does; in fact, he said, 'i did a concept review'," crawford added.in the videos he also told her about seeing demons and angels, but she said he does not exhibit the kind of mental behavior that would support those claims.she pointed out he never mentioned the apparitions to anyone until he first told his defense attorney after being arrested for murder.dr. crawford also said it was unusual that none of his family, friends or co-workers ever observed symptoms of his alleged manic depressive condition.prosecutors then called neuman's former ge boss to the stand.eric gebhardt testified that in the six years neuman worked directly under him he never noticed any manic depressive behavior or anything that interfered with neuman's excellent job performance."was he having trouble keeping a grip on reality?" asked district attorney robert james."no," replied gebhardt."was there any reason to doubt his mental state?" james asked."no," gebhardt said.the state's final witness of the day was dr. william brickhouse, who runs the mental health program at the dekalb county jail.he testified that he's observed and interacted with neuman several times since his january 2011 arrest and never saw any evidence of delusions, hallucinations or anything else to suggest he is mentally ill.dr. brickhouse will continue his testimony when the trial enters its fourth week monday morning.comments ( ) | share your thoughts ¯

80	teach yourself borland delphi 4 in 21 days -- appendix c -- building internet applicationsbuilding internet applicationsare you one of those people who think the internet is just a fad, something that will never last? if so, let me tell you something...you're wrong! the internet is huge and it's getting bigger every day. in part, the internet is about the web and about people spending hour after hour browsing the web. but the internet is also about file transfers, email, and electronic commerce. the internet is big business. it isn't going away anytime soon, so you might want to polish your internet programming skills. thankfully, delphi makes it easy to experiment with internet programming and to do serious internet programming as well.today, you look at some aspects of internet programming with delphi. there's a whole world waiting out there on the internet, so let's get to it.internet components available in delphithe internet components in delphi are located on the internet page of the component palette and come in two categories. the first category is a group of components provided by netmasters. with one exception, these are native vcl components. the exception is the thtml control, which is an activex control. table bd.1 lists the netmasters controls and provides a description of each control. the controls are listed in the order in which they appear on the component palette.table bd.1. netmasters activex internet controls.obtains the date and time from internet daytime servers.sends text to and receives text from internet echo servers.obtains information about a user from an internet finger server.performs file transfers between networked machines using ftp (file transfer protocol).performs file transfers using http (hypertext transport protocol). hypertext documents are normally viewed in a web browser. you use thttp to retrieve web documents that don't need to be displayed in a web browser.sends simple ascii text messages using tcp/ip.receives messages sent with the tnmmsg control.sends messages to and receives messages from internet news servers using nntp (networking news transfer protocol).retrieves email messages from mail servers using pop3 (post office protocol).encodes or decodes mime or uuencoded files.sends email through smtp (simple mail transfer protocol) mail servers.sends data streams to a network or internet stream server.receives streams sent by the tnmstrm control.obtains the date and time from internet time servers.transfers data across networks using udp (user datagram protocol).encapsulates the winsock api.used for general tcp/ip servers.displays html (hypertext markup language) files. this is a webconverts url data to a readable string and string data to url format.the second category of controls includes native vcl components provided by borland. the tclientsocket and tserversocket components come with both the professional and client/server versions of delphi. the web broker components (twebdispatcher, tpageproducer, tquerytableproducer, and tdatasettableproducer) come with only the client/server version. the vcl internet components are listed in table bd.2.table bd.2. native vcl internet components.manages a tcp/ip client socket connection.manages a tcp/ip server socket connection.converts an ordinary data module to a web module.enables building of dynamic html pages.takes tquery results and generates an html document from them.tdatasettableproducertakes tdataset records and generates an html document from them.these two groups of controls give you all the power you need to build high-quality internet applications.building a web browserone of the most visible internet programming tasks is building a web browser. certainly it's the most glamorous. the good news is that it can also be the easiest.who needs yet another browser?you might be wondering why anyone would want to build a web browser. after all, the world already has netscape navigator and internet explorer, so who needs another browser? true enough, you probably aren't going to try to build a web browser that competes with netscape or microsoft. on the other hand, consider a company that has hundreds or even thousands of employees who need access to the web. it can be very costly to license thousands of copies of a commercial web browser. on the other hand, you can write a quality web application with delphi in just a few hours, thereby saving the company a lot of money.another reason a company might want a custom web browser is to restrict access to the web. for example, there might be sites on the internet that employees have to visit from time to time. a custom web browser enables access to authorized sites on the web but not to any other (unauthorized) sites. in fact, a custom browser is perfect for your kids!finally, one of the most compelling reasons for a custom web browser is an intranet . an intranet is a web site that is local to a particular network. an intranet can contain a variety of information for a company's internal use--information on company benefits, company policies, an employee address book, meeting schedules, or even information on the company bowling league. a custom web application can provide access to an intranet and prevent access to the internet.so with that in mind, you'll build a simple web browser. you'll probably be surprised how easy it is.first steps in building your browserthe thtml control is a ready-to-use web browser. all you have to do is place one of these controls on a form and call the requestdoc method. well, that might be a little oversimplified, but you can display a web document from anywhere on the internet as easily as that. with that in mind, let me show you how quickly you can write a web browser application. here are the first steps:1. start with a new application. change the form's name property to webmain and the caption property to ez web browser.2. place a panel component on the form and change its align property to altop and its height property to 60. clear the caption property.3. place a combobox component on the panel. move it near the top of the panel and make it as wide as the panel itself. change the name property to urlcombobox. change the text property to an url of your choice (try http://www.turbopower.com). double-click the constraints property and change the anchorhorz constraint to akstretch.4. place a statusbar component on the form. it will automatically position itself at the bottom of the form. change its name property to statusbar and its simplepanel property to true.5. place an html control in the middle of the form. change its align property to alclient. the html control fills the screen. change the name property to html.now your form should look similar to the one shown in figure bd.1. if your application doesn't look exactly like figure bd.1, adjust as necessary or just leave it. (a little individuality isn't a bad thing, after all.)at this point, you should save the project. save the form as webbrwsu.pas and the project as webbrows.dpr. now you'll add just enough functionality to make the browser do something useful.figure bd.1. your new web browser after the first steps.6. click on the url combo box. generate an event handler for the onclick event. type the following code in the event handler:if urlcombobox.text <> `' then   html.requestdoc(urlcombobox.text);the requestdoc method loads the requested document after first checking that the combo box contains text.7. now generate an event handler for the onkeypress event. type the following code in the event handler:if key = char(vk_return) then begin   key := #0;   if urlcombobox.text = `' then     exit;   urlcomboboxclick(sender); end;this code first checks the key parameter to see whether the enter key was pressed. if so, it sets key to 0 and calls the urlcomboboxtest method (created in step 6). setting key to 0 prevents the speaker from beeping when the enter key is pressed. the call to the urlcomboboxclick method loads the url into the web browser.8. now compile and run the program. type an url in the combo box and press enter. if you typed in a valid url, the page will load in the html control.wow! a web browser in 15 minutes! notice that the browser acts like any other web browser...well, sort of. you need to add a lot of functionality, but it's a start.note: if you are fortunate enough to have a full-time internet connection, your new browser will work immediately. if you are using dial-up networking with auto dial enabled, the dialer will start automatically and connect to your internet service provider (isp). if you don't have dial-up networking installed, you have to connect to the internet manually before running the program.adding a progress indicatoryou now have a good start on your web browser. one of the features you are missing is some status information on each page as it loads. what you'll do is add a routine that updates the status bar as a page loads. you make use of the thtml control's onupdateretrieval and onendretrieval events to obtain periodic status updates. you will use the getbytestotal and getbytesdone methods to calculate a percentage and then display the percentage loaded in the status bar. ready?1. click on the html control on your form. generate an event handler for the onupdateretrieval event. add code to the event handler so that it looks like this:procedure twebmain.htmlupdateretrieval(sender: tobject); var   total   : integer;   done    : integer;   percent : integer; begin   total := html.retrievebytestotal;   done  := html.retrievebytesdone;   if (total = 0) or (done = 0) then     percent := 0   else     percent := ((done * 100) div total);   statusbar.simpletext := format(     `getting document: %d%% of %dk', [percent, total div 1024]); end;2. now generate an event handler for the onendretrieval event. type this code in the event handler:statusbar.simpletext := `done';take a closer look at the code in step 1. there isn't very much to it. the getbytestotal method tells you how many bytes are in the document or the embedded object currently being loaded (objects include images). the getbytesdone method gives the number of bytes that have been retrieved for the page or object up to this point. from there it's a simple matter to calculate the percentage of the object that has been retrieved. finally, you format a string with the information obtained from the html control and send it to the status bar. the code in step 2 simply updates the status bar after the entire document has been loaded.run the program again and watch what happens when you load a page. the status bar shows the percentage loaded for the page and for any embedded objects.some finishing touchesnow for some finishing touches. first, you'll add some buttons beneath the url combo box. (for a peek at the finished product, see figure bd.2.) here goes:1. place a button on the panel beneath the url combo box. make its name property gobtn and change its caption to go!.2. generate an event handler for the onclick event for the new button. enter the following code in the event handler:urlcomboboxclick(self);3. place another button on the panel, just to the right of the first button. change the name to stopbtn and the caption to stop.4. generate an event handler for the onclick event for this button and type the following code in the event handler:statusbar.simpletext := `done';5. place a third button on the panel to the right of the other two buttons. change the name property to reloadbtn. change the caption property to reload.6. create an event handler for the onclick event for this button and enter the same code as in step 2:urlcomboboxclick(self);7. place a fourth (and final) button on the panel. change the name to sourcebtn and change the caption to view source.8. create an event handler for the onclick event and enter this code:html.viewsource := not html.viewsource; if html.viewsource then   sourcebtn.caption := `view document' else   sourcebtn.caption := `view source';your form should now look like the one shown in figure bd.2.figure bd.2. the ez web browser with buttons in place.these steps introduce a couple of new thtml elements. the cancel method stops the process of loading a document. the viewsource property is used to toggle between viewing the document as html source or as a regular html document.now run the program again. check out the new buttons and see what they do. in particular, give the view source button a try.okay, you're almost done with your web browser. let's add a couple of more features. you are going to respond to two more events of the thtml control in order to provide more status information.1. generate an event handler for thtml's ondorequestdoc event. type this code in the event handler:statusbar.simpletext := `connecting to ` + url + `...';2. now create an event handler for the onbeginretrieval event. when the event handler appears, type this code:statusbar.simpletext := `connected...'; urlcombobox.items.insert(0, urlcombobox.text);in this sequence, step 1 makes use of the ondorequestdoc event, which is generated when a document is requested. the url parameter of the dorequestdoc event handler is the url of the site to which you are connected. as long as the url is provided, you can use it to build a string to display in the status bar. step 2 adds a little more status information when the document actually starts to load. it also takes the url and adds it to the url combo box's list. you need to make sure that you have connected to a site before adding the url to the list of visited sites.congratulations, you have finished (or nearly finished) your first internet application. figure bd.3 shows the ez web browser in operation.figure bd.3. the finished ez web browser displaying a page.hey, that's good work! there are some things that your web browser doesn't do, but it does a lot, so you can be proud. stand back and admire your work. you can take your new creation and add some new features of your own. one feature you might want to add is a list of urls that can be used to implement browse buttons (back and next). you could also replace the standard buttons with a toolbar and add glyphs to the toolbar's buttons. if you really want to add the ultimate touch, provide an animation while the document is loading so that your users can tell when your browser is doing something. you can do that most easily with a timagelist component, although the tanimate component would work, too.the thtml control has several properties that i didn't cover. most of these properties have to do with user preferences such as background color, the color of links, the color of visited links, the various fonts used for each heading size, and so on. i'm not going to explain those properties because they are easy to figure out. for the most part you can just accept the default values for these properties. if you want to customize your browser further, though, you can certainly spend some time reviewing the properties list for the thtml control.listing bd.1 lists the browser program's main unit.listing bd.1. webbrwsu.pas.unit webbrwsu; interface uses   windows, messages, sysutils, classes, graphics, controls, forms, dialogs,   stdctrls, extctrls, olectrls, nmhtml, comctrls; type   twebmain = class(tform)     panel1: tpanel;     urlcombobox: tcombobox;     statusbar: tstatusbar;     html: thtml;     gobtn: tbutton;     stopbtn: tbutton;     reloadbtn: tbutton;     sourcebtn: tbutton;     procedure urlcomboboxclick(sender: tobject);     procedure urlcomboboxkeypress(sender: tobject; var key: char);     procedure htmlupdateretrieval(sender: tobject);     procedure htmlendretrieval(sender: tobject);     procedure gobtnclick(sender: tobject);     procedure stopbtnclick(sender: tobject);     procedure reloadbtnclick(sender: tobject);     procedure sourcebtnclick(sender: tobject);     procedure htmldorequestdoc(sender: tobject; const url: widestring;       element: htmlelement; docinput: docinput;       var enabledefault: wordbool);     procedure htmlbeginretrieval(sender: tobject);   private     { private declarations }   public     { public declarations }   end; var   webmain: twebmain; implementation {$r *.dfm} procedure twebmain.urlcomboboxclick(sender: tobject); begin   if urlcombobox.text <> `' then     html.requestdoc(urlcombobox.text); end; procedure twebmain.urlcomboboxkeypress(sender: tobject; var key: char); begin   if key = char(vk_return) then begin     key := #0;     if urlcombobox.text = `' then       exit;     urlcomboboxclick(sender);   end; end; procedure twebmain.htmlupdateretrieval(sender: tobject);  var   total   : integer;   done    : integer;   percent : integer; begin   total := html.retrievebytestotal;   done  := html.retrievebytesdone;   if (total = 0) or (done = 0) then     percent := 0   else     percent := ((done * 100) div total);   statusbar.simpletext := format(     `getting document: %d%% of %dk', [percent, total div 1024]); end; procedure twebmain.htmlendretrieval(sender: tobject); begin   statusbar.simpletext := `done'; end; procedure twebmain.gobtnclick(sender: tobject); begin   urlcomboboxclick(self); end; procedure twebmain.stopbtnclick(sender: tobject); begin   html.cancel(0);   statusbar.simpletext := `done'; end; procedure twebmain.reloadbtnclick(sender: tobject); begin   urlcomboboxclick(self); end; procedure twebmain.sourcebtnclick(sender: tobject); begin   html.viewsource := not html.viewsource;   if html.viewsource then     sourcebtn.caption := `view document'   else     sourcebtn.caption := `view source'; end; procedure twebmain.htmldorequestdoc(sender: tobject; const url: widestring;   element: htmlelement; docinput: docinput; var enabledefault: wordbool); begin   statusbar.simpletext := `connecting to ` + url + `...'; end; procedure twebmain.htmlbeginretrieval(sender: tobject); begin   statusbar.simpletext := `connected...';   urlcombobox.items.insert(0, urlcombobox.text); end;using internet explorer as an activex controlif you have microsoft internet explorer installed on your system, you can use it as an activex control. the first thing you need to do is import the control into delphi's component palette. after that, you can place it on a form just as you would any control. first, let me show you how to import internet explorer. (i showed you how to import activex controls on day 15, "com and activex," but it doesn't hurt to review.) here are the steps:1. choose component | import activex control from the main menu. the import activex dialog box is displayed.2. locate microsoft internet controls (version 1. x ) in the list of activex controls (see figure bd.4). if you have internet explorer 3 installed, the version number will be 1.0. if you have internet explorer 4 installed, the control will be listed as version 1.1. notice that the class names field shows twebbrowser as the control contained in this file. if you have internet explorer 4, the class names field will also show twebbrowser_v1 (the original webbrowser control) and tshellfolderviewoc.figure bd.4. the import activex dialog box.3. click install to install the control (the rest of the fields on this dialog box can be left on their default values).4. the install dialog box appears asking for a package name. click on the into new package tab at the top of the dialog and type ie in the file name field. (you can type a description if you want, but it's not necessary.) click ok to create the package.5. a confirmation dialog box appears asking whether you want to build and install the package. click yes to create the package.delphi builds the package and then displays a dialog box saying that the twebbrowser control has been installed. now you can try out the control:1. first, choose file | close all to close all windows, and then create a new application.2. click the activex tab on the component palette. choose the webbrowser control and drop it on your main form. size the control as desired, but leave room on the form for a button.3. drop a button component on the form. double-click the button to generate an onclick event handler. type the following code in the event handler (use any url you want):webbrowser1.navigate(`http:\\www.turbopower.com',    emptyparam, emptyparam, emptyparam, emptyparam););as you might surmise, the navigate method loads the document in the web browser.4. click the run button to run the program.when the program runs, click the form's button. the web page will load and be displayed in the webbrowser control.when you install this control, delphi creates a unit called shdocvw_tlb.pas. you can look at this unit to see what properties and methods are available for twebbrowser.tip: you can find documentation for the webbrowser control on microsoft's web site. search the microsoft site for the text reusing the webbrowser control.notice that you can't redistribute the twebbrowser control itself without obtaining a license from microsoft. however, if you know your users have internet explorer installed on their systems, your application will work because the control is already installed. you still have to register the control on your user's machine for your application to run. see "deploying internet applications" later in this chapter for more information on registering activex controls.there are many reasons you might want to send mail from one of your applications. the good news is that sending email isn't difficult at all. maybe you want your program users to be able to email you with any problems they encounter. in that case, your application could pop up a form containing a memo component and a send button. your users can type text in the memo component, press the send button, and the message is emailed to you. you can even go so far as to attach a log file from your application to diagnose any problems the user is having.the tnmsmtp control is used for sending mail through an smtp server. smtp is an odd protocol in that it doesn't require authenticated logon to the server (at least on most smtp servers). you can simply connect to any mail server, send the email message, and disconnect. the host property is used to specify the host name of the mail server to which you want to connect. most of the time, you can just use mail as the host name. specifying mail tells the tnmsmtp control to connect to your local mail server, whether it's your isp's mail server or your company's mail server.if you want, you can specifically set the mail server name (such as mail.mycompany.com), but it isn't usually necessary. if you specify an incorrect mail server, you get an esockerror exception. the port property is used to specify the port on which to connect. the default smtp port is port 25. the port property defaults to a value of 25, so you shouldn't have to change this property.all the pertinent information for the mail message itself is contained in the postmessage property. this property is a class that contains properties such as toaddress, fromaddress, subject, body, and so on. you fill in the appropriate fields of the postmessage property and then send the message.before you can send a mail message, you need to connect to the smtp server. this is done with the connect method:smtp.host := `mail'; smtp.connect;after you're connected, you can send the email. the onconnect event handler is a good place for this code because you know that you are connected to an smtp server. for example:procedure tmainform.smtpconnect(sender: tobject); begin   with smtp.postmessage do begin     fromaddress := `bilbo@baggins.com';     toaddress.add(`gandolf@baggins.com');     subject := `test';     body.add(`this is a test');   end;   smtp.sendmail; end;this code sets up the fromaddress, toaddress, subject, and body parameters of the postmessage property and then sends the message with the sendmail method. it's as simple as that. notice that the toaddress and body properties of postmessage are tstringlists. the mail message body can contain several lines of text, so it's not surprising that the body property is a tstringlist. the toaddress property is also a tstringlist, so you can specify several recipients for the message.note: the fromaddress and toaddress fields are required fields. all other fields (even the message body) are optional.after you know the message has been sent successfully, you can disconnect from the smtp server. the onsuccess event is generated when the mail has been sent. your onsuccess event handler might be as simple as the following:void __fastcall tform1.smtpsuccess(tobject *sender thenyou can send several messages per connection, of course. if you have several messages to send, you don't have to disconnect from the server and reconnect for each message. just connect once, send all your messages, and then disconnect from the server.your mail message might go through without incident, or it might fail in one way or another. in either case, you must be prepared to disconnect from the server. the onfailure event is generated if the mail message fails to go through, so you can use that event to disconnect from the server as well as the onsuccess event. the book's code, found at http://www.mcp.com/info, contains a simple mail program that illustrates how to send mail with tnmsmtp.deploying internet applicationsif your internet application uses only the vcl internet components, there is nothing special to do when you deploy your application unless you are using runtime packages. if you are using runtime packages, you need to ship inet40.bpl, and if you are using the page producer components, ship inetdb40.bpl as well.deploying an application that uses activex controls, however, requires more work. activex controls must be registered on the machine on which your application will run. the easiest way to register activex controls is with a good installation program. installshield express comes with delphi professional and client/server versions, so you should try that program. another good installation program is wise install from great lakes business solutions. the better installation programs register, as part of the installation process, the activex controls that your application uses.if you don't use a commercial installation program, you have to manually register any activex controls your application uses. the tregsvr.exe utility is used to register and unregister activex and ocx controls. this utility is in your delphi 4\bin directory. for example, to install the ez web browser application you created earlier today, you ship the following files:html.ocx nmocod.dll nmsckn.dll nwm3vwn.dll nmorenu.dll webbrows.exeafter you install all these files, you have to run tregsvr.exe on the html.ocx and nmocod.dll files to register them. from the command line, you typedo the same for nmocod.dll. the thtml control is now registered on your user's machine and your program will run as intended.note: if you don't register your activex controls properly, your users will see a message box that says, "class not registered." when they attempt to run your program. your application will then terminate, leaving your users wondering what went wrong.to unregister a control, use the /u switch as follows:here again, a good installation program will have an uninstall option that takes care of this for you.as you can see, activex controls require a bit of work to install after your application is built. if you aren't aware of the fact that you need to register the activex controls, it can lead to confusion for both you and your users. by the way, the files needed to deploy an application using the thtml control total about 900kb, so using activex controls can be expensive in terms of disk space. i prefer to use native vcl controls whenever possible for exactly this reason.today you learned about the internet components provided in delphi. you built a simple but usable web browser with the thtml control, and you learned how to send mail using the tnmsmtp control. internet programming is big business right now. it certainly can't hurt to have some internet programming experience.the workshop contains quiz questions to help you solidify your understanding of the material covered and exercises to provide you with experience in using what you have learned. you can find the answers to the quiz questions in appendix a, "answers to the quiz questions."q what components or controls should i use to create a tcp/ip client/server application?a use the tclientsocket and tserversocket components.q can i create web pages from my database tables?a yes. the tquerytableproducer and tdatasettableproducer components create an html document from a database table. you can learn more about these components by examining the sample projects in the delphi 4\demos\webserv directory.q the tnmsmtp control is for receiving mail and the tnmpop3 control is for retrieving mail. why are there two controls for email operations?a there are two controls because there are two separate mail protocols: one for sending mail (smtp) and one for retrieving mail (pop3).q when were most of the internet protocols (smtp, pop3, ftp, udp, and so on) defined?a you might be surprised to learn that many protocols used in internet programming have been around for 20 years or more even though the internet is much younger than that. the internet protocols were originally designed for the unix platform.1. what control do you use to display web pages?2. what control do you use to connect to newsgroups?3. what is the name of the method used to display an html document with the thtml control?4. what event is generated when an html document has completed loading?5. what control do you use to send email messages?6. what control do you use to retrieve email messages?7. what is the name of the method used to send mail with the tnmsmtp control?8. can you freely distribute the internet explorer activex control?9. what is the name of the utility used to register activex controls?10. what company provides the bulk of the internet controls that come with delphi?1. write an application for sending email. the application's main form should have fields for the from address, the to address, the mail subject, and the message text.2. add forward and back buttons to the ez web browser application and make them operational.3. extra credit: add animation to the ez web browser application so that the user can tell when the browser is loading a document.

85	serese's alaska holiday vacation blogserese's alaska holiday vacation blogupdated: mon 6:14 pm, jun 22, 2009today was the day we could have struck it rich!this morning we headed to the el dorado gold mine. when we got there, we boarded the tanana valley railroad for a ride through the original gold fields of the interior - to a present day working gold mine. we watched a demonstration on how to pan for gold - then it was our turn. we all received a bag of what could literally be a gold mine, but it was our job to discover if we had trash or treasure. we dumped the bag into a big medal bowel and began the panning process. while some of us took a little longer than others to find our gold - none of us walked away empty handed. after we collected our gold - we had it weighed. surprisingly, todd had the most gold with more than 21 grains. i had just more than 10. many of the ladies had their gold put into lockets on either a necklace or a bracelet. unfortunately, none of us hit the golden jackpot!our next stop was the trail breaker kennel - which is home to the late susan butcher's iditarod champion sled dogs. we had lunch there and heard a presentation about mushing and racing in the iditarod and yukon quest. as part of the presentation, susan butcher's husband wanted to illustrate the attire an iditarod racer would have to wear in order to brave temperatures as cold as 60 below zero. but for his demonstration he needed help from the audience - and before i knew it i was the person chosen. first, he put a gigantic beaver hat on my head, then he began to add more layers -including huge beaver gloves, thick boots, heavy insulated overalls and of course the biggest, warmest jacket i've ever seen. it was so hot under all those layers - that i thought i could pass out - but i survived and maybe one day i'll share those pictures - maybe.from there we took a riverboat cruise aboard the discovery iii stern-wheeler on the chena and tanana rivers - where we got a chance to learn how native alaskans lived years ago. it was fascinating to see the clothing and shelter the people used years ago - and the ride was wonderful.we then headed to our hotel for a night on our own.because tonight is the longest day of summer, there was a huge celebration going on in downtown fairbanks. todd and i took a shuttle downtown for the "midnight sun festival" where there were bands, vendors and great food. we ended up dining with another couple from our group and had some great alaskan barbecue.today - there will be 21 hours and 50 minutes of daylight. wow!!
86	the main techniques fitzgerald used to introduce our main character gatsby  ::  english literaturethe main techniques fitzgerald used to introduce our main character gatsbylength: 628 words (1.8 double-spaced pages)- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -the main techniques fitzgerald used to introduce our main character gatsbyauthor's techniques by fitzgeraldfitzgerald is a very diverse and interesting author to analyze. thetechniques he uses for each character or theme that he wants topresent is different from page to page, thus making him awhen speaking of the title character of the book, jay gatsby, thereare a few specific techniques used in the layout of his features.gatsby doesn't appear in the book in flesh and blood until the thirdchapter of the book however by that time nick carraway has receivedenough second hand information about him. however there is of course awaited with the introduction of this man;the more we waited for the great gatsby the larger his reputation grewin order for us to build a predetermined view about him.the main techniques fitzgerald used to introduce our main charactergatsby was reputations and postponed introduction thus creating a lotof mystery around this man. at first when nick enters one of gatsby'sparties he doesn't see the host indulging himself in the luxuries ofthe crowd, food and music though instead he is nowhere to be seen.this is a very surprising enigma for nick since generally you wouldpresume that whoever has this much wealth would thrive in showing itoff to his guests. on top of this, you have a lot of rumorscirculating every one of his parties. catherine mckee once said thatgatsby is "the son of kaiser wilhelm", the current ruler of germany.of course every speculation made was false however as nick heard themall, his anticipations for their meeting grew. this is a clevertechnique since not only does it enhance gatsby's character importancein the novel though it shows how little the supporting characters ofwe hear all sorts of rumors about how gatsby acquired his wealthhowever not until chapter vii do we have definite proof of how hismoney came about. on page 140, two thirds into the book, tom confrontsjay about who he really is. it is during that event where tom throwsall the facts about his bootlegging in jay's face `i found out whatyour "drug-stores" were-` he turned to us and spoke rapidly. `he andthis wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and inchicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. that's one of hislittle stunts.....'what about it? said gatsby politely. `i guess yourfriend walter chase wasn't too proud to come in on it.' this is thefirst time in the book where a character confronts jay about his pastand current business. not surprisingly, he doesn't deny any of hiswork though instead throws back a snappy comment.the fact that we have a predetermined view on this character makes iteven more interesting for us to read on and to find out that thiswealthy upper-class man has a sensitive, love-sick side to himself.fitzgerald uses all of these techniques to accentuate the importanceof greatness and fake glorification in gatsby's life. gatsby knowsthat he isn't all of what he has created himself to be: the man thateveryone loves to create rumors about. however this all apart of theessence of being the "great gatsby", since by creating a lot ofmystery and suspense around who he really is and where he has comefrom, he can draw more attention to himself; thus luring in daisy.fitzgerald's techniques are classical and are designed to draw moreattention to this man of illusions and secrecy in order for us tounderstand the role of this man in the novel.how to cite this page"the main techniques fitzgerald used to introduce our main character gatsby." 123helpme.com . 01 jan 2014<http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=98716>.important note: if you'd like to save a copy of the paper on your computer, you can copy and paste it into your word processor. please, follow these steps to do that in windows:1. select the text of the paper with the mouse and press ctrl+c .2. open your word processor and press ctrl+v .123helpme.com (the "web site") is produced by the "company". the contents of this web site, such as text, graphics, images, audio, video and all other material ("material"), are protected by copyright under both united states and foreign laws. the company makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the material or about the results to be obtained from using the material. you expressly agree that any use of the material is entirely at your own risk. most of the material on the web site is provided and maintained by third parties. this third party material may not be screened by the company prior to its inclusion on the web site. you expressly agree that the company is not liable or responsible for any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of other subscribers or third parties.the materials are provided on an as-is basis without warranty express or implied. the company and its suppliers and affiliates disclaim all warranties, including the warranty of non-infringement of proprietary or third party rights, and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. the company and its suppliers make no warranties as to the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the material, services, text, graphics and links.

94	the 54th new york infantry, the "hiram barney rifles", the "schwarze yaeger" | the 11th corps of the army of the potomacwith the new school year starting, i'll be switching over to semi-monthly postings.  my next series of posts will deal with the 54 th new york infantry, another of von gilsa's units present at blocher's knoll and east cemetery hill during the battle of gettysburg.  today's post will introduce the regiment.the 54 th new york was another of the predominantly "german" regiments of which the 11 th corps was so well known.  organized by eugene kozlay, who became the regiment's commanding officer, the 54 th was originally intended to be a sharpshooting regiment.  the war department would not accept the regiment into service until 400 men were on the rolls.  therefore, while the regiment began accepting enlistments in june of 1861, it was not until the very end of august that orders were received to muster the regiment.  the soldiers were mustered in between september 5 and october 16, 1861, and the regiment was made up of men mostly from brooklyn and new york city.  the 54 th was alternatively known as the "hiram barney rifles", "barney black rifles" or the "schwarze yaeger".  hiram barney was a democrat, but was lincoln's appointment as collector of the port of new york.  colonel kozlay notes in his regimental journal that barney's only connection to the regiment was that he presented a few flags to the officers.  the inclusion of barney's name was merely at the request of hamilton bruce.from october 1861 to april 1862, the 54 th new york was stationed around washington.  at that time, they were transferred west to fremont's command near strasburg, virginia.  in june 1862 the regiment participated in the battle of cross keys.  later that month, they were transferred into pope's army of virginia, this time under command of franz sigel.  they skirmished at multiple rappahannock crossings in the days leading up to 2 nd bull run and were present at groveton and 2 nd bull run.like other 11 th corps regiments in von gilsa's command, they were present at chancellorsville and gettysburg; later posts will provide more details on this service.  camped near hagerstown, maryland, after gettysburg, they were transferred to south carolina in august 1863.  they became part of the 10 th corps on folly island, south carolina, and participated in the siege of fort wagner.  in summer 1864, the 54 th new york transferred to james island until march, 1865, when they entered charleston, south carolina.  the men stayed in south carolina until april 1866, almost a year after hostilities were ended, serving on duty to the freedmen's bureau.the uniform of the 54 th new york was black and silver, hence the name "black rifles" or "schwarze jaeger".  in fact, the regiment originally had a black flag with skull and crossbones but it was not approved of and was not used for long.  what a sight that would have been in battle if authorized...  colonel kozlay noted in his regimental journal that $300 was paid for an embroidered regimental flag, but i have yet to find any evidence as to whether it is the "pirate" flag or a subsequent more traditional regimental flag.it is important to note that we tend to think of regiments such as the 54 th new york as "german" regiments.  i have found that, due to political geography,  "german" in the 1860s can include nationalities such as german, austrian, polish, hungarian and others.  in fact, colonel kozlay and other officers of the 54 th were hungarians.the next few posts will use colonel kozlay's journal as a jumping-off place for a more detailed look at the 54 th 's history in the civil war and an interesting perspective on the life and times of a regimental commander.leave a reply cancel replyfill in your details below or click an icon to log in:email (required) (address never made public)you are commenting using your wordpress.com account.
